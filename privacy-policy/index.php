                <h1>10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h1>
                <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-
                    Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
                    about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology
                    standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not
                    currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates
                    your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must
                    follow
                    in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
